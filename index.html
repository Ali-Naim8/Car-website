      <p>IF DROPPING A few million dollars on a brand new supercar isnt enough to get you going, maybe it's time you considered a classic. Like, say, the 1957 Jaguar XKSS going up for sale next month. Just be sure to warn your accountant ahead of time, because auction house Gooding & Co. expects this rolling sculpture to sell for $16 to $18 million.</p>
      <p>What makes the XKSS one of the most valuable cars on the planet? More than the obvious beauty of those curves, rarity: Jaguar built just 16 examples of this car. (It planned for 25, but a factory fire destroyed nine unfinished chassis.) It's been more than a decade since one of the sweet 16 went up for sale</p>
      <p>The XKSS is a more refined, road-going version of the racing-oriented Jaguar D-Type. This car, chassis number 716, lived with its first owner in Montreal, saw a bit of action on the track, and was fully restored about a decade ago. If the bidding at Florida's Amelia Island Auction gets frenzied—likely, since who knows when another XKSS will come up for sale—the D-Type that fetched $21.8 million at auction last year could look the bargain.</p>
      <p>In an odd twist, you can also opt for a new XKSS: Jaguars classic division is now building the nine "lost" nine cars, with a few tiny updates for safety, and selling them for just $1.25 million or so. But wheres the fun in that?</p>
